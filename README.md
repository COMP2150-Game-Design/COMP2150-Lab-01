# Week 01 - Github, Unity and The 2D Tile Maker
Today will be focused on a refresher of Github, Unity and an introduction to the 2D Tile Maker in Unity, a tool that you will need to use for your Level Design assignment. By the end of this worksheet, you should:

* Have your Github account linked to your Student ID.
* Know how to clone, commit and push to Github repos.
* Understand how to create a simple scene using the 2D Tile Maker.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity

## Assignment deliverable
You will not be directly working on an assignment today, but instead setting up the workflows necessary for the assignment (i.e. using Github appropriately).
